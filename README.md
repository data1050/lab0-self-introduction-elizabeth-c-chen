Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!

Hi! My name is Elizabeth and this is my first year in the program (/only year in the program since I'm a 5th year Master's student). I grew up in New York City but my family now lives in Rhinebeck, NY (about 1.5-2 hours from the city). My favorite food is roasted brussels sprouts with parmesan sprinkled on top. Brussels sprouts get a lot of hate but they can be really yummy if you know what to do with them!

Note to TAs:

I was confused about which branch to use and had initially edited the README file on `master` and ran `git add .` after filling out the file, but then I thought that we were supposed to work on the `handin` branch so I did `git reset`. I then switched to the `handin` branch, and the README file showed the same content that I had typed in on `master`. I realized I had made a mistake when I tried to do a new pull request but it was only showing "Able to merge" if I had the `master` and `handin` branches in opposite positions compared to the screenshot in the Google doc. 

I tried running `git revert <hash>` with the commit hash I got from `git log` and pushed it again. So I have two extra commits in history from that.
