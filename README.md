Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!

Hi! My name is Elizabeth and this is my first year in the program (/only year in the program since I'm a 5th year Master's student). I grew up in New York City but my family now lives in Rhinebeck, NY (about 1.5-2 hours from the city). My favorite food is roasted brussels sprouts with parmesan sprinkled on top. Brussels sprouts get a lot of hate but they can be really yummy if you know what to do with them!
